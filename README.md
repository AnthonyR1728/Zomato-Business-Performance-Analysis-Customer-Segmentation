# Zomato Customer Analysis: Tableau Project

## Project Overview
   - This project aims to perform Customer Segmentation Analysis for Zomato, a leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery service. The main objective of this analysis is to better understand who Zomato’s customers are, what they do, and what they want, which will ultimately help increase customer lifetime value.

   - Using the Users and Orders datasets provided by Zomato, we will analyze customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and spending habits. The results of this analysis will be presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, allowing for better visualization and understanding of the customer segments.

## Project Goals

  - Customer Segmentation: Identifying customer groups based on demographic factors such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, and income.

  - Purchasing Behavior: Analyzing how customer segments interact with Zomato, including their spending patterns, order frequency, and seasonal trends.

  - Business Insights: Drawing actionable insights to improve customer engagement and boost customer lifetime value.

## Data

  - The analysis uses the following key datasets:

    - Users: Contains demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, and income.

    - Orders: Includes order details such as order history, order date, and spending amounts.

  - The datasets are joined to provide a comprehensive view of each customer’s demographics and their order history.

  - The following insights have been gained through the analysis:

    - Customer Segments: Certain customer segments, such as high-income individuals and those in specific occupations, show higher spending levels and more frequent orders.
    
    - Seasonal Trends: The data shows clear seasonal trends, where spending spikes during certain months. For instance, certain customer segments increase their orders around holidays and special occasions.

    - Top-Spending Customers: A small group of customers contribute significantly to overall revenue. Understanding their behavior and tailoring marketing efforts toward these high-value customers can help Zomato improve customer retention.
